Ok all you need to do is copy and paste these three commands in terminal just minus the #

#sudo wget -O //home/pi/pi_first_boot https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcpender/pi_first_boot/master/pi_first_boot

#chmod u+x pi_first_boot

#./pi_first_boot


This is just a script i have put together with programs I have found and like. 
I didn't write any of these programs I simply got sick of installing them 
evertime I started my Pi from scratch again.

If you wish to use it you need to run it as root

Everything so far come from NovaSpirit as after trying out lots of others 
his are the best i've come across

I have modified NovaSpirits .conkyrc file 
as i am running the offical raspberry pi 7" touch display

I DID NOT WRITE THESE PROGRAMS . . . 

So Far this Script does the following -

Update
Upgrade 
Install Conky + add all Conky config files

Install wbar + config
ZRAM


GitHub to come

I will update it with more as I find them
