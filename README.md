This is just a script i have put together with programs I have found and like. 
I didn't write any of these programs I simply got sick of installing them 
evertime I started my Pi from scratch again.

Everything so far come from NovaSpirit as after trying out lots of others 
his are the best i've come across

I will be modifying his version of the Conky config file 
as i am running the offical raspberry pi 7" touch display

I DID NOT WRITE THESE PROGRAMS . . . 

So Far this Script does the following -

Update
Upgrade 
Install Conky + add all Conky config files
Install wbar + config

To come ZRAM

I will update it with more as I find them
